            <img src="images/LyndonHerschell.jpg" class="about-photo" alt="Lyndon Herschell">
        <p>I am in my senior year at Penn State Behrend majoring in Digital Media, Arts, and Technology (DIGIT).</p>
        <p>I have a passion for digital creation, and I'm currently working as a student research assistant at the Virtual/Augmented Reality and Interactive Arts (VARIA) Lab located in the Lilley Library at Penn State Behrend.</p>
        <p>Ever since I was young, I've had a fascination with video games, which was expressed mainly through playing them. Eventually this would lead to a desire to further appreciate and understand what goes into making a game. I have since learned game development skills through the courses found at Behrend.</p>
        <p>I am constantly looking for opportunities to enhance my abilities, aiming to thrive in an environment that prioritizes innovation, creativity, and streamlined solutions. I would be excited to contribute my expertise to any role or business venture.</p>
        <p>If you'd like to know more about my work and experience, feel free to check out my resume below:</p>
